# Stack
This implements the properties of stack. Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.

## Operations
-----
Stack consists of various operations:

- Push :  If we want to add another item to stack, then we add it at the top of the stack. This operation is known as Push
- Pop : If we remove an item from the stack. This is also done from the same end i.e. the top of the stack. This operation is called Pop.
